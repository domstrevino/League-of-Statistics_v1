# WindowsApplication

This project is a comprehensive web-scraping application that aims to provide data-driven content for any/every League of Legends player within the North American region. This current version was built using C#, WinForms, and SQL Server.

THIS PROJECT DOES NOT WORK AT THE MOMENT and will not progress past the initial startup screen due to the outdated HTML Nodes that the program targeted. This program was rebuilt with ASP.NET Razor Pages but the source code for it was lost due to the machine it was running on being completely wiped.

I am in the process of redesigning the entire application using C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, and JavaScript.
